# ideo_py
**Ideo**matic **Py**thon, my (first) steps

I once was quite good at writing ideomatic Ruby. But after switching over to Python, as may new main language, I struggled in both languages. My Ruby became less and less fluent and my Python, well it remained mediocre. Perhaps I didn't write enough code at all, perhaps I didn't read enough about ideoms in python. It doesn't matter. This is my way to change it.
