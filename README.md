Learning ideomatic Python

I once was quite good at writing ideomatic Ruby. But after switching over to Python as may new main language now I struggled in both languages. My Ruby become less and less fluent and my Python, well it remained mediocre. Perhaps I didn't write enough code at all, perhaps I didn't read enough about ideoms in python. It doesn*t mattter. This is my way to change it.
